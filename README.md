# Basic-Portfolio
### This is a basic portfolio website.  It has 3 pages: an about me, a portfolio, and a contact form.  You can switch between the pages using the navigation bar in the upper right corner.  The about me page has space for an image and some text. The portfolio page has a grid of images with labels to represent possible projects. The images could easily be turned into links to other pages by putting anchor tags around the `<div>`s used as labels.  The contact form has inputs for name, email, and a message, though it is not functional.
